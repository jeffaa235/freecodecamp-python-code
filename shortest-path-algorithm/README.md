# shortest-path-algorithm

This is a python program to find the shortest path to a node given a starting node and a target node. The algorithm `shortest_path(graph, start, target="")` calculates the shortest path to every node by
starting from the `start` node and moving towards the next closest node while updating the distances of each `current` node to every one of its connected nodes.

## Example Input
`shortest_path(my_graph, 'A', 'B')`
