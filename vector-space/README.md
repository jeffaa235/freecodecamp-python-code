# vector-space

In this project, we used classes, inheritance, and special methods of classes like `__add__`, `__sub__`, `__mul__`, `__eq__`, `__gt__` to define a
2D and 3D vector class called `R2Vector` and `R3Vector`. We used special methods to define various operations like adding and subtracting vectors,
cross product of vectors, dot product of vectors, and scalar multiplication of vectors.
